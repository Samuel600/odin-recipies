      <p>
        The Banga stew (ofe akwu) is very easy to make and very popular in the
        eastern part of Nigeria, almost every ingredient used in Making this
        stew could be harvested from the farm. That is why it is a little easier
        for folks in rural areas while it remains difficult for people outside
        the country to find all the ingredients that are required. This is
        another kind of Nigerian stew popularly eaten by the Igbos and some
        other parts of Nigeria; I would prefer this stew above Nigerian tomato
        stew any day. This is a bowl of a delicious plate of rice, served with
        banga stew (ofe akwu) plus a sprinkle of peas. (I boiled the peas for 3
        minutes on low heat)

        <li>Banga (palm fruit) (9-10 cups)</li>
        <li>1 kg of assorted meat</li>
        <li>500 g mackerel</li>
        <li>A cup of Sliced onions</li>
        <li>2 cups of sliced fluted pumpkin(optional)</li>
        <li>3 seasoning cubes</li>
        <li>A cup of sliced Scent leave</li>
        <li>Dried fish (200g)</li>
        <li>Half cup of ground Crayfish</li>
        <li>Half cup of ground Crayfish</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>preparation</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Soak the dried fish in hot water and wash thoroughly to remove sand
          and dirt, blend the crayfish or blend with dry pepper if you are
          making banga stew with dried pepper.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          Chop the onion and scent leaves, set aside in a plate, I like to make
          most foods with lots of onions just because of its health benefits
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          Cook the palm fruits (banga fruits) for 30 to 50 minutes then pound
          with a mortar and pestle, you will see how this is done in the video
          below.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          Pour water in a bowl, add the pounded palm fruit and try to squeeze
          out the thick paste. The palm fruit juice is a major part of banga
          stew I can also use this in making other Nigerian soups.Pour the
          squeezed-out thick juice into a bowl and set aside.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          Wash the meat and mackerel (fish) with water and parboil with a
          separate pot till it is tender. Season with 2 stock cubes, a teaspoon
          of salt, half cup of sliced onions). Remove the fish after 10 minutes.
          It is possible to make a delicious meal with tasteless meat, that is
          the only reason I precook the fish/meat separate before adding them to
          the main pot.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          Add the squeezed-out palm fruit juice to the boiling meat on fire.Add
          the (washed, dried fish and blended crayfish) to the cooking pot and
          allow to simmer for about 10 minutes
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          Add your spices if it is not yet as tasteful as required. (Sachet of
          “onga soup” and/or a seasoning cube). Stir and add the scent leave
          (chopped), sliced onions, salt and pepper to taste. Add the precooked
          mackerel fish. I added the fish now because I want to serve them
          whole. If you add fish earlier to banga stew, they would break before
          the stew is made.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          Cover and cook for another minute then add the chopped vegetables
          (Ugu)(optional), allow to simmer for another 3 minutes and you just
          made a delicious Nigerian banga stew (ofe akwu) Serve with rice, yam
          or cooked beans.
