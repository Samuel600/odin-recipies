      <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>
        Vegetable soup is paired with any of the swallows in Nigeria and served
        as either lunch or dinner. This recipe shows you how to cook a healthy
        soup with vegetables (ugu and water leaves) the Nigerian way. I love
        this soup for many reasons: For starters, I made it with vegetables, and
        those are synonymous with health. In Nigeria, we combine different
        vegetables to make different soups. Okra soup, Afang soup and even
        edikaikong are different combinations of different veggies. Veggies are
        good for the heart and body cells.

        <li>Big bowl Waterleaves</li>
        <li>Big bowl ugu leaves (fluted pumpkin)</li>
        <li>Roasted mackerel</li>
        <li>1KG or 35 Ounces of Goat meat</li>
        <li>1 cup crayfish</li>
        <li>6 scotch bonnet peppers</li>
        <li>400ml Palm oil</li>
        <li>2 seasoning cubes</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>tablespoons Ground Ofor</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Preparation</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Slice the water leaves and fluted pumpkin leaves with a kitchen knife,
          you want them thinly sliced as you can see below. What you find below
          is a bowl of fluted pumpkin leaves – vegetables. This is the
          equivalent of 12 cups. You should wash ugu (fluted pumpkin) properly
          before slicing them.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          You can wash the water leaves after slicing them. Wash the leaves
          properly and transfer into a sieve to strain excess water. You don’t
          want too much water in your vegetable soup.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          Wash the roasted fish,remove center bone and break to smaller bits as
          you can see below.Season the goat meat with a teaspoon of salt, sliced
          onions and two seasoning cubes. Allow the meat to boil, add two cups
          of water and let the meat cook until it becomes tender and easy to
          chew.Pound the scotch bonnet (peppers) and 1 cup of crayfish together.
          You could blend them if you like. Set aside on a small plate.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          To the boiling meat, add the washed, roasted fish. Allow them to cook
          until the water dries. Don’t allow it to burn. Most people don’t like
          too much water in their vegetable soup, to achieve that, use some
          tricks – like boiling the meat/fish till the water is almost dried.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          When the meat cooked and the water is almost completely dried, add the
          palm oil, 400ml. You need lots of palm oil when you cook vegetable
          soup.Now you add the vegetables, the water leaves should come first.
          It should fill the pot, it will go down in 3 minutes as you continue
          to stir.You can add the leaves little by little, so it doesn’t fill
          the pot and become difficult to stir. After adding all the water
          leaves, allow it to simmer for 2-4 minutes while you stir
          occasionally.Add the pounded crayfish and peppers. Stir all together
          and taste for salt, add salt to your taste. You don’t want too much
          salt.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          Add the ugu leaves (fluted pumpkin) at this point. Stir in 2
          tablespoons of ofor (used as a thickener). Turn properly so it doesn’t
          form crumbs.Stir all together and allow the vegetable soup to simmer
          for three minutes.
        </li>
